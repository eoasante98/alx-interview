# Rotate 2D Matrix
An algorithm task given by ALX in the ALX Software Engineering specialization. The purpose of this task is to enable us to be more conversant with algorithm and also have the enabling thought process in problem solving.

## Thought process to solution
- No need to create a new matrix, I'll just use the matrix passed to the function as argument.
- Reflect the matrix along the leading diagonal or negative slope diagonal.
- Rotate the resulting matrix along the middle
