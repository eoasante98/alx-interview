# Making Change
An algorithm task given by ALX in the ALX Software Engineering specialization. The purpose of this task is to enable us to be more conversant with algorithm and also have the enabling thought process in problem solving.

## Thought process to solution
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount of total.
```
def makeChange(coins, total):
```
Note:
- If total is 0 or less, return 0
- If total cannot be met by any number of coins provided, return -1
- 'coins' is a list of the values of the coins in your possession.
- The value of a coins will always be an integer greater than 0
